Note from Peter Karlsson:

"html" contains the stuff that was on the web site. html/data contains the
scripts that generates all the pages. This stuff was on the web server.
updatepages.sh is the script that did that, and I used to run it once a week
from cron, and when adding new files. *.input are the source files.
html/alternative contains other formats, mostly HTML and PDF versions. Seems
to be missing a link to the "c64_fr" (C64 User Manual, French) from the
index.html :-(

"sourcefiles" is my local source tree, which contains all the documents
unpackged, and in some cases also other source files. This stuff was in my
local home directory.

"pending" contains the e-mail with pending additions.
