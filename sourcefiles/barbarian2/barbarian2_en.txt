Welcome to iDOC= - the international CBM documentation project!

The goal of iDOC= is to preserve (non-English) Commodore related documents
in electronic text format that might otherwise cease to exist with the rapid
advancement of computer technology and declining interest in 8-bit computers
on the part of the general population. If you would like to help by
converting Commodore related hardcopy documents to electronic texts please
contact the manager of iDOC=, Peter Krefting, at peter@softwolves.pp.se.

Extensive efforts were made to preserve the contents of the original
document. However, certain portions, such as diagrams, program listings, and
indexes may have been either altered or sacrificed due to the limitations of
plain vanilla text. Diagrams may have been eliminated where ASCII-art was
not feasible. Program listings may be missing display codes where
substitutions were not possible. Tables of contents and indexes may have
been changed from page number references to section number references.
Please accept our apologies for these limitations, alterations, and possible
omissions.

Document names consists of a reasonably short unique title, followed by the
document language. Two optional fields follow; first the document version (0
for incomplete texts, version 1 is usually unnumbered), and then the
document source, if there are more than one. Finally, the document is given
a .txt extension.

PROLOGUE

At the finale of BARBARIAN - THE ULTIMATE WARRIOR, the barbarian defeated the
warriors of Drax and thus freed Princess Mariana from his evil spell.

Drax fled to the dungeons beneath his black castle, vowing to wreak disaster
on the Jewelled Kingdom.

It is decided that there is only one way to stop Drax. The barbarian and
Mariana - herself an accomplished swordswoman - are the only two warriors
skilled enough to survive the perilous journey to Drax's lair. They must stop
him before it is too late.

  BARBARIAN II - THE DUNGEON OF DRAX

CHOICE OF CHARACTER

You may choose to play either the barbarian or Princess Mariana. At the
beginning of the game the two characters will appear. Chose your warrior by
moving the joystick left or right and pressing FIRE.

LEVELS

You must fight your way through three levels - the Wastelands, the Caverns,
and the Dungeons - before arriving at the fourth level, the Inner Sanctum of
Drax. These sections must be played in the correct order.

Each of the first three levels is a maze consisting of approximately 28
screens. As you view each screen it is possible to walk left, right, or into
doors or caves at the back of the screen.

The direction you are walking, as viewed on the map, is continually changing
and therefore a compass (in which the sword always points north) has been
provided at the bottom of the screen.

When you reach the exit to the next level the Level Display will pulse as a
warning. It is not advisable to leave a level without first collecting all
available magical objects (see below).

MONSTERS

On each of the first three levels you must fight six different types of
monster, some of which can be killed with one well-placed blow.
They are:

[The Wastelands] Saurian beasts, Neanderthal men, Apes, Mutant Chickens,
Stabbers, Floaters.

[The Caverns] Carnivores, Orc Guards, Crabs, Slithering Things, Cave Trolls,
Stingers.

[The Dungeon] Pit Things, Dungeon Masters, Giant Grubs, Gobblers, Eyes,
Orclets.

If you survive to the sanctum of Drax you must face The Living Idol, a great
Demon and, finally, the dreaded Drax!

MAGICAL OBJECTS

In each of the first three levels there are two magical objects that you will
need to collect in order to survive throughout the quest.

[The axe] increases your strength;
[The globe] guards against death from Drax's magic;
[The potion] increases your resistance;
[The key] opens portcullis doors;
[The shield] guards against instant death from the Demon's fire;
[The jewel] disables the Living Idol when the idol is reached.

ENERGY AND LIVES

Your energy is displayed as a bar at the top right of the screen. When it
runs your you lose a life.

You start the game with five lives. More lives can be gained throughout the
game by collecting any skulls you may find. These contain the life-force of
warriors who have preceded you. When you lose all your lives you restart the
current level.

The energy of the current monster you are fighting is displayed as a bar at
the top left of the screen. When it runs out the monster is destroyed.

SCORING

The more difficult fighting moves will score highly and do more damage.

JOYSTICK MOVES

These are your joystick moves when you are facing right (reverse these when
facing left).

 WITHOUT FIRE BUTTON PRESSED        WITH FIRE BUTTON PRESSED
             RUN                   OVERHEAD    OR   RUNNING JUMP
              ^                      CHOP      ^   (WHEN PRECEEDED
              |                                |        BY RUN)
   WALK  <---   --->  WALK         FLYING <---   ---> KICK
BACKWARDS    / \    FORWARDS        NECK       |
            / | \                   CHOP       V
     THROUGH  |  THROUGH                      LOW

            TURN
           AROUND

To jump across holes or pits you will need to make a running jump. If you do
not jump far enough you will find yourself on the far edge of the hole. By
swiftly waggling the joystick left and right you may save yourself.
