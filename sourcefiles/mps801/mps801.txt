Section 1: GENERAL INFORMATION

Welcome to a new dimension in computing. Because you bought the Commodore
MPS-801 printer, you've added a great deal of versatility and convenience to
the use of your Commodore computer. This manual contains all the information
you need to check out, hook up, and operate your printer, but in order to get
the most out of your computer system you should continue to look at both
your computer's User's Guide and Programmer's Reference Manual.

Your MPS-801 printer is designed to operate through software control. That
means you have to make the printer's operation part of a program. For example
the VIC-20 has a TYPEWRITER cartridge that comes in the VIC SIX-PACK.

The MPS-801 Printer prints both capital and small letters, numbers, and all the
graphic characters available on your computer. It will even print custom made
graphics and charts that you design on your VIC-20 or Commodore 64. In
addition your printer has a variety of built-in functions of its own. This is
because your printer has its own computer inside.

The advantages of this internal computer are 1) it automatically resets all its
switches to the starting sequence every time you turn the printer on: 2) it
contains its own internal memory which means that you can store information
to be printed directly in the printer without using up your computer's memory.

Your printer is designed to connect directly into your computer through the
Serial Port (6-pins). However, you can connect your printer to as many as 4
1541 disk drives by chaining. Chaining means connecting 1 peripheral to your
computer and any additional peripherals plug into the Serial Port of the last
item connected.

4. Connecting the Printer to Your Computer

To connect your printer to your Commodore computer, please follow the in-
structions in the order listed below

        -11-

a. Make sure that both your computer and printer have their power turned
   OFF.

b. Connect one end of the 6-pin DIN cable to the connector holes located in
   the back of your printer at the lower left. This cable is "keyed" so that
   you cannot plug the cable in the wrong way. This means that the pins
   should be positioned so that a slight pressure will seat the cable properly.
   Do not force these pins in, doing so could damage your cable.

c. Connect the other end of the cable to your computer in the Serial Port
   Connector located in the back of your computer. Make sure that you are
   "keying" the pins properly into the connector with 6 holes.

d. Now plug the printer's power cord into a standard AC wall outlet. How-
   ever, please do NOT turn the equipment on yet.

5. Performing the Printer Power-On Test

Please do NOT turn on your computer until after have completed the next
two sections.

a. Turn on your printer. The print head should move to the center of the
   carriage automatically and then return to the original position. If this
   doesn't happen, go to step "b".

b. If the print head does not move as described above, check to see if the
   connecting cable is properly plugged in. After checking all connections
   turn your printer on and try the test again.

6. Performing the Print Head Test

You can test the print head and ribbon. ONLY AFTER INSERTING PAPER.
DO NOT PRINT WITHOUT PAPER; it could easily damage your print head.
To perform the test, simply switch the self-diagnostic switch to "T" (shown
in Fig. 2.12). The printer will continue to print all the characters
available until 1 ) the printer is turned off; or 2) the self-diagnostic
switch is "flipped" to position 4 or 5. When the printing is finished,
remove the paper from the machine and examine it for defects. Please
report any problems immediately to your local Commodore dealer so that
your printer can be properly serviced. A typical printout is shown below.

                         2) Wrong ribbon setting.
                         Re-adjust the ribbon
                         3) Old or worn-out ribbon.
                         Replace the ribbon.
        -14-

8. Cautions

* Wait at least two seconds to turn on the power after it is turned off,
  otherwise the Printer will not be initialised properly.

* Never place the Printer where it is exposed to direct sunlight.

* Never apply power while you are plugging in or unplugging an input
  connector.

* Never turn off the power while the Printer is in motion.

* Never try to move the print head manually, whether the power is on
  or off.

* Do not stop the print head motion while it is printing.

* Do not print without paper and/or ribbon because the print head might
  be damaged.

* Turn off the power quickly and remove a foreign object, if you drop it
  into the Printer.

*   Do not subject the Printer to temperatures below 5øC or above 35øC
    during operations, or to a sudden change in temperature.

* Regarding printing duty:
  In graphic mode, using patterns with too much dot density will wear
  out the print head faster. We recommend that you use patterns whose
  dot density is equal to that of ordinary alphanumerics. The continuous
  printing of high dot density patterns may adversely affect the longevity
  of the print head.

* Unplug the power cord before trying to take off the outer casing.

Section 3: USING YOUR PRINTER

Introduction

Now that you've learned how to insert the ribbon and paper into your printer,
connect the printer to your computer, and how to test your printer for
problems, you're ready for the next step: putting the printer to work for
you.

Your printer does a lot more than give a clean, fast printing of your work.
It has own internal microprocessor (computing system) which makes it both
versatile and practical. In addition, it doesn't need to use up precious
memory space in your computer because it stores everything you want to print
in its own memory.

In this section we will show you how to use your printer to print listings,
program results, and graphic displays. You will also see how to make double
width characters and even how to create a few custom designed graphics. But
before you go any farther in this manual, make sure that you are able to do
the following:

  1. Operate your Commodore computer.
  2. Write elementary programs in BASIC,
  3. Read and write files to and from a peripheral device, like a tape
     cassette recorder or disk drive.
  4. Open and close files.

If you are not familiar with any of the above procedures, check your
computer's User's Manual for the information you need.

1. Special Printer-Associated Commands

When you want to print something on your printer, essentially what you are
doing is transferring the video screen function to the printer. A few special
BASIC commands allow you to make this transfer. Most of the other rules and
syntax of BASIC remain the same. Don't forget to type the RETURN key after
each line of information.

The OPEN Command

This command creates a correspondence between a file number and a physical
device. The logical file number (lfn) may be any number from 1 to 255. It
doesn't matter which number you choose, as long as you keep the same number
throughout your set of commands.

        -16-

The device number (dn) refers to the device to which you send the file.
The first device number is also known as the primary address. If you are
using a MPS-801 printer, the dn (device number) is usually 4. Check the
test switch on your printer to see what dn to choose.

The secondary address (sa) is an optional and unique printer concept.
Secondary address on this printer provides the following printer options.

         sa = 0: Print data in graphic (upper case/graphic) mode
         sa = 7: Print data in business (upper/lower case) mode

The SYNTAX for the OPEN Command is:

         OPEN lfn, dn                  or             OPEN lfn, dn, sa
         OPEN 99,4                     or             OPEN 1,4,0
         OPEN 2, 4                     or             OPEN 26, 4, 7

The CMD Command

The CMD command transfers control from the computer to the printer. The
lfn (logical file number) must be the same as the one you chose for the OPEN
command. If you are using more than 1 OPEN command, each CMD command
must have the same number as the corresponding OPEN command. Unlike a
PRINT# command (which is discussed next), the line to the receiving device
(in this case your printer) is left open. The device given the CMD command is
said to be "listening." That means that once you give the CMD command, your
printer will print READY and it will then be open and waiting for further
instructions. At this point, any PRINT or LIST command will go directly to
the printer as output.

The SYNTAX for the CMD Command is:

       CMD lfn
       CMD 99
       CMD 2
       (notice that the CMD logical file numbers correspond
       to the OPEN lfn's)

The PRINT# Command
The PRINT# command works just like the BASIC command PRINT except
that it directs the output to the printer instead of to the video screen.
After the data you have sent to the printer is finished, the lfn is
automatically closed. This is called "unlistening" and it means that in order to PRINT# more data,
you must re-open the file by using another CMD command. By the way, please
notice that you can NOT leave a space between PRINT and # or the command
will not work.

        -17-

  NOTE: In Commodore BASIC, the PRINT command can be abbreviated by using
  a "? ". You can NOT do this with PRINT#. You must always type PRINT# in full

SYNTAX for the PRINT# Command is

     PRINT# lfn, data
     PRINT# 99, "HELLO VIC"
     PRINT# 2, CHR$(124), 123, 63, 76

The CLOSE Command

The CLOSE command is a very important command to use efficiently. You could
always CLOSE a file after you've printed from it. The reason is that you
can only have a maximum of 10 files open at anytime. Therefore, if you make a
habit of closing files when you've finished with them, you will always have
the maximum number of files available.

 NOTE: Since the CMD command does not close the line to the
 printer, you must always follow a PRINT# command with the
 CLOSE command in order to properly close a file.

The SYNTAX for the CLOSE Command is:

     CLOSE lfn
     CLOSE 99
     CLOSE 2

SAMPLES Using all commands correctly:

     OPEN 99, 4
     PRINT#99, "HELLOVIC"
     CLOSE 99

     OPEN 99, 4
     CMD 99, "HELLO VIC"
     PRINT#99: CLOSE 99

     OPEN 2, 4
     PRINT#2, CHR$(124), 123, 63, 76
     CMD2
     PRINT#2
     CLOSE 2

        -18-

2. Printing in the Direct Mode

Now that you have gone through the various printing commands and what they
do, let's put them to use in practical applications The DIRECT mode allows you
to communicate with your printer by entering printing commands Directly
from the keyboard of your computer.

The following example illustrates the entire DIRECT mode listing process in a
short BASIC program. In this example, a file containing a single BASIC state-
ment is typed into the computer's memory. The file is then OPENed. The out-
put channel to the printer is opened and the printer is "listening" using the
CMD command. The file is LISTed. The output channel is closed using the
PRINT# command. Finally the file is CLOSEd. The printer is now out of use
and the computer is ready to accept new commands.

You type:     ³  The screen displays:  ³  The printer prints:
1. 10?"TEST"  ³  10?"TEST"             ³
2. OPEN 3,4   ³  OPEN 3,4              ³
              ³  READY.                ³
3. CMD3       ³  CMD 3                 ³  READY.
4. LIST       ³  LIST                  ³  10 PRINT"TEST"
              ³                        ³  READY.
5. PRINT#3    ³  PRINT#3               ³
6. CLOSE3     ³  CLOSE3                ³
              ³  READY.                ³
                                        
                        Table 3.1

Explanation of above program:

(1) Data placed in the computer's memory.
(2) You OPEN a file and give it a logical file number (Lfn) of 3. The 4
    (follow-ing the comma) makes the file available to the printer.
(3) The printer is "listening."
(4) The program is LISTed onto the printer. The printer is still "listening."
(5) Use the PRINT# command to "unlisten" the printer.
(6) You CLOSE the file so that the lfn 3 can be used for something else.

        -19-

3.    Printing Under Program Control

Now that you have seen how to control the printer directly from the keyboard,
it's time to control the printer from within a BASIC program. The short BASIC
sample below would already be in the computers memory It could have been
placed there from the keyboard, a cassette tape, or a floppy disk.

10 OPEN 3,4
70 CMD3
30 PRINT"PROGRRM CONTROL"
40 LIST
        Figure 3.2

The RUN command is given and the resulting printout is shown here:

PROGRAM CONTROL

10 OPEN 3,4
20 CMD3
30 PRINT" PROGRAM CONTROL"
40 LIST

READY.
        Figure 3.3

REMEMBER THIS! When using the LIST command within a program execution,
you must type the PRINT# command to close the channel. Then type the
CLOSE command to close the file after you have finished RUNning the file.
Although this works, it is NOT good programming practice. It is suggested
that you only use the CMD command and DIRECT mode.

4. Secondary Address

This printer has 2 secondary address (sa). They are used to the character
front table.

       sa = 0: graphic mode.. . (default)
       sa = 7: business mode

The following example tells you how to use secondary address.

100 OPEN4,4
110 PRINT#4,"              ASCII CODE TABLE"
120 PRINT#4
130 A$= "012345678ABCDEF"

170 PRINT#4,"-+";
180 FOR I = 1 TO 16: PRINT#4, "--" : NEXT
190 PRINT#4
200 FOR I=1 TO 16
210 PRINT#4, MID$(A$, I, 1 ) " | ";

230 IF J<32 THEN GOSUB330: GOTO260
240 IF J> 127 AND J<16O THEN GOSUB330: GOTO260
250 PRINT#4 CHR$(J)" ";
260 NEXT J
270 PRINT#4
280 NEXT I
290 PRINT#4 :PRINT#4

5. Printing Modes and Control Codes

You can also use your printer and the PRINT#, CMD and PRINT commands
in conjunction with CHR$ codes to do the following:

DESCRIPTION                             INPUT CODE

Enter Bit Image Mode ...................CHR$(8)
Line Feed After Printing ...............CHR$(10)
Carriage Return ........................CHR$(13)
Enter Double Width Character Mode ......CHR$(14)
Enter Standard Character Mode ..........CHR$(15)
Tab Setting the Print Head .............CHR$(16)
Enter Business Mode in Local ...........CHR$(17)

        -22-

Start Reverse Field ...................................CHR$(18)
Repeat Bit Image Selected .............................CHR$(26)
Specify Dot Address (must follow Print Head Tab Code)..CHR$(27)
Enter Graphic Mode in Local ...........................CHR$(145)
Turn Off Reverse Field ................................CHR$(146)

5.1 Standard Character Mode

When the printer is turned on, it is set to start in the STANDARD CHARAC-
TER mode. But once you select different character modes the printer will
remain in that mode until a different one is chosen using the CHR$ code. For
the example below, we started in double width mode "CHR$(14)" for the title
and then went to the stand character mode "CHR$(15)" to list the program.

M P S - 8 0 1   P R I N T E R (in double width)

10 OPEN 1,4
20 PRIHT#1,CHR$(14)"MPS-801 PRINTER"
30 PRINT#1,CHR$(15)
40 CMD 1: LIST

READY.
Figure 3.7

5.2 Double Width Character Mode

To print in the DOUBLE WIDTH CHARACTER mode, use the CHR$(14)
code and follow the example below.

10 OPEN2,4
20 PRINT#2, CHR$(14) "MPS-801 PRINTER"
30 CLOSE2

RUN

M P S - 8 0 1   P R I N T E R (in double width)

5.3 Bit Image Mode

By using CHR$(8) you enter the bit image mode This allows you to design

        -23-

and print bit image graphics by inputting data. Each DATA statement is made
of numbers that represent a row of dots which, when READ all together, will
make up your bit image graphic. To design your bit image graphic, follow the
example below. You should notice that each number in the DATA statement
corresponds to 1 row in your bit image graphic. To design a bit image graphic,
follow these steps:

 1. Get a separate piece of paper to design your picture,

 2. Number 7 consecutive rows like this:

       1
       2
       4
       8
       16
       32
       64

 3. Now design your bit image graphic in dot form (see the example below).

 4. Add together all the numbers from the column on the left, only whenever
    you have placed a dot in a row. In our example, the first column has 3
    dots located in rows 4, 8, 16. Added together they equal 28.

 5. Now add 128 to the total you had for each column in step 4. In our
    example we add 128 to 28 for a total of 156.

 6. Put your final total for each column into a data statement in column order.

  1 . . * * . . .
  2 . * . . * * .
  4 * . . . * . .
  8 * . . . . . .    (Direction of print head movement)
 16 * . . . * . .
 32 . * . . * * .
 64 . . * * . . .
128
 156 162 193 182 162

The DATA statement in your program will read:

      DATA 156,162,193,182,162

The following program will print COMMODORE with its logo 4 times.

10 DATA 156,162,193,193,182,162
20 FOR I = 1 TO 6
30 READ A
40 A$=A$+CHR$(A)

        -24-

50 NEXT I
60 OPEN3,4
70 FOR I=1TO4
80 PRINT#3,CHR$(8)A$;
90 PRINT#3,CHR$(15)" COMMODORE"
100 NEXT I
110 CLOSE3

After typing RUN, you get this result:

C= COMMODORE
C= COMMODORE
C= COMMODORE
C= COMMODORE
Figure 3.9

5.4 Print Position Determination

With the CHR$(16) code you can determine the print start position. This is
done by assigning a 2-digit number following the CHR$(16) (see the examples
below).

Example 1

10 OPEN4,4
20 FOR I = 1 TO 4
30 PRINT#4,"0123456789";
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT#4, CHR$(10);
60 PRINT#4,CHR$(16)CHR$(48)CHR$(56)"MPS-801";
70 PRINT#4,CHR$(16)CHR$(51)CHR$(48)"PRINTER"
80 CLOSE4

RUN

0123456789012345678901234567890123456789
       MPS-801                PRINTER

Figure 3.10

-25-

Example

10 OPEN4, 4
30 FOR I = 1 TO4
30 PRINT#4,"0133456789";
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT#4, CHR$(10);
60 PRINT#4, CHR$(16)"08MPS-801" ;
70 PRINT#4, CHR$(16)"30PRINTER"
80 CLOSE4

RUN

0123456789013345678901334567890123456789
        MPS-801               PRINTER

Figure 3.11

The 2-digit numbers following the CHR$(16) code are the print start position
of your standard character. This can be proven using the following example.

10 OPEN4, 4
20 FOR I = 1 TO4
30 PRINT#4, "0123456789" ;
40 NEXT I
50 PRINT#4, CHR$ (10);
55 PRINT#4, CHR$ (14);
60 PRINT#4, CHR$ (16)"08MPS-801" ;
70 PRINT#4, CHR$ (16)"30PRINTER"
80 CLOSE4

RUN

0123456789013345678901334567890123456789
        M P S - 8 0 1         P R I N T E R  (double width)

Figure 3.12

5.5 Print Start Position-Dot Address

Using the CHR$(27), the absolute address (dot units) can be specified via the
following format.

CHR$(27)   CHR$(16)     CHR$(HP)     CHR$(LP)

Figure 3.13

        -26-

The 2 bytes that follow CHR$(27) and CHR$(16) are binary data used to
indicate the absolute address away from the home position (dot units).

NOTE FOR THESE NEXT TWO TABLES (fig 3.14, 3.15)  THE LETTER P OR D FOLLOWED
BY A NUMBER MEANS THE LETTER TO THE POWER OF THE NUMBER. EG  D6 = D TO THE
POWER OF 6. THIS IMPROVISATION IS CAUSE BY THE USE OF PLAIN ASCII.

          D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0
1st byte  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0     Higher 1 bit (HP)
2nd byte  P7 P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P1 P0    Lower 8 bits (LP)

        Figure 3.14

The above 2 bytes are used to indicate the staring print position and are
treated as a single 9 bit binary notation data inside the Printer.

P8 P7 P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P1 P0
        Figure 3.15

For example the dot address 15 can be determined by HP=CHR$(0),
LP=CHR$(15).

5.13 Data Buffer Size

Your printer's printÄline buffer can contain up to 90 byes of data. At least
1 byte will be used for the CHARACTER mode. But . . . since your printer
provides you with automatic printing, you are guaranted that no loss of data
due to overflow will occur. This means that you really don't have to worry
about buffer size. In addition to the print data, the following will also be
included in your buffer:

        Input Code                                  Bytes                                                                      Byes
        CHR$(8) ......................................1
        CHR$(10) .....................................1
        CHR$(13) .....................................1
        CHR$(14) .....................................1
        CHR$(15) .....................................1
        CHR$(16)/CHR$(HP)/CHR$(LP) ...................3

6. Automatic Printing

Automatic printing will occur under 3 conditions. In order to understand ex-
actly what's happening, you have to have a little knowledge about how your
printer works. First, each printed character is made from 6 rows of dots. Next,
you can have up to 80 characters per printed line (spaces count as 6 dot
positions just like letters and numbers). This means that there are a total
of 480 dots per line. Now you're ready for the 3 conditions.

a.   When the buffer fills up during the input of data.

b.   When your printer "sees" that you have used up more than the 480 dots
     per line that was described above.

c.   When both a and b happen at the same time.

What will happen when these conditions occur?

a. When the buffer fills during printing, it prints out everything is has been
   storing onto your paper. But . . . it remembers where it stopped printing
   so that it can continue from that point, when and if you want to. Or it
   will print again when you fill the buffer again.

b. When the printer uses up more than 480 dots, then it prints out the line
   and then stops and tells you that it's READY for more information.

c. When both a and b occur, your printer will "dump" only the first 80
   characters and print them. Then it will move to the next line. At this
   point, the printer will do 2 things: 1 ) It will hold any characters that
   have been left in the buffer and add to them; 2) It will give you a READY
   for more information statement.
