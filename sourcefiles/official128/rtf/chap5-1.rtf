This chapter will also be useful if you're familiar with CP/M on another computer and want to know how Commodore's CP/M is different. CP/M stands for Control Program for Microcomputers. That doesn't tell you much but it does give a hint of what CP/M is: a way to control programs. CP/M is a special kind of \fs24 \f3 \i disk \fs24 \f2 \plain \f2 \lang1033 operating system. A disk oper\-ating system is a sort of supervisory program that is used to do chores, such as run programs, make copies of programs, erase files, measure the capacity of a disk, and so on. In this chapter we will tell you what CP/M is, its value and features, what you need to use it, what important and powerful CP/M software exists and where to find it, and finally a bit about its commands and what they do. We will also tell you where to go for more detailed information on CP/M.\par

And if you read the chapter in this book on the new C128 mode you know that Commodore has provided an even more powerful set of BASIC statements and commands for accessing the disk (borrowed from the Commodore CBM line of small business com\-puters). From within BASIC you use these commands to find out what files and programs are on the diskette in the drive, to erase programs or to duplicate them on other diskettes, and even to run programs written in languages besides BASIC. Unfortunately, these disk management features exist inside the shell of another language, and have more complex syntax then we would desire. What they do is insulate us from having complete control over files and programs on the disk.\par

One purpose of a disk operating system is to simplify the han\-dling of programs and Ales. This is done in CP/M by providing a set of commands that are easy to use and remember. Since CP/M is not inside or part of another language, such as the disk commands of Commodore 64 or BASIC 7.0, its use is more straightforward. A disk operating system like CP/M is actually a kind of "mother" or supervisor program. It is the program you use to control other programs\'97a sort of master that conducts the operations of any "application" program on the disk.\par

Commodore chose CP1M not just because it offers more or better DOS commands, but because it offers a huge body of software that can now be run on the Commodore 128. CP/M has a unique position in the world of microcomputers. It was the first operating system developed for microcomputers (CP/M came out around 1975\'97 three years after the introduction of the first microcomputer: the Altair 8080). It was first developed so that many different computers could run the same program. A program that was written to run under the CP/M operating system on one computer would work on another computer if it also ran CP/M. Over the course of many years, many manufacturers pro\-duced machines that ran CP/M, a huge body of software was developed for these computers, and a new industry was born. Today there are dozens of companies that manufacture CP/M computers and a fantastic selection of software you can choose from.\par

Gary developed a package of compactly written subroutines for the tiny (and now ancient) four\_bit Intel 4004 microprocessor. These subpro\-grams could be used by other programs, simplifying the work for other Intel programmers. As technology advanced, more powerful chips were developed, including the Intel 8008 and 8080 microprocessors, and the 8080\_compatible Zilog Z80 microprocessor. Kildall went on to develop more routines for the 8080 and the compatible Z80. His overall goal was to create an environment that would allow storing and running programs on a disk. Because no one believed that microcomputers would ever become very popular or that they would ever use an expensive contraption like a disk drive, Intel gave Kildall the okay to market CP/M on his own. He started up a company called Digital Research, which to this day is still going strong.\par

These drives were slow because they used a serial method to transfer data from the disk to the computer, and because of certain design elements in the way the disk drive communicated with the computer. The new 1571 and 1572 drives are much faster then the 1541 drive. The old drives transfer data at 320 characters per second. The new drives in the CP/M mode can transfer at a rate of 3500 characters per second, which is more than ten times faster. These new drives contain an intelligent microprocessor, which gives the Commodore 128 an advantage over all other CP/M computers. In the early days of CP/M, all software was distributed on 8\_inch diskettes and only one storage format was used. When 51/. inch disk drives became popular, manufacturers used different format techniques. Dozens of stor\-age formats now abound, making compatibility a problem.

The best and most expensive way is to purchase a new Commodore 1902 80\_column color monitor. This new monitor produces beautiful color and will work with the Com\-modore 64, Commodore 16, Plus/4, and Commodore 128. The display has a resolution of 640 by 200 pixels and can display an array of 16 colors. A new video chip in the Commodore 128, which is much like the one used in the IBM PC, drives this display in the 80\_column mode. It is apparent that Commodore expects that programs now running on the IBM PC in the color mode will easily be reverse engineered to work in the Commodore 128 CP/M mode.\par

When the computer is first turned on, a set of character fonts stored in the ROM is moved into RAM. When CP/M wants to display a character, it gets it from this memory area. Since the characters are stored in RAM, it is possible to modify them and to create custom characters for your programs. It also means you can mix graphics and text on the same screen with CP/M.\par

A monochrome monitor is one that displays in only one color. On the color monitor the text characters are stretched a bit too much in the vertical direction, but are still quite readable. The Commodore color monitor includes built\_in speaker, volume, color, tint, brightness, and contrast controls.\par

This mode uses the standard VICdisplay chip found in the 64 and can be used with a standard 40\_column Commodore 1702 color monitor. The 1702 monitor is less expensive than the new 1902, but it cannot display the entire 80\_column line that CP/M programs expect. Instead, the first\par

The only require\-ment is that the CP/M software be available on 51/. inch floppies. One particularly thorny problem with distribution of CP/M software is the disk format. When CP/M was originally created it used 8\_inch single density, single\_sided diskettes and a single storage format called IBM System 34. There now exist several new floppy storage possibilities, including double\-density, and double\_sided. When the 51/. inch disks arrived, several man\-ufacturers of CP/M computers, including KayPro, Morrow, and Osborne \'97makers of CP/M portables\'97slightly altered the storage format to suit their particular hardware. As a consequence there is incompatibility be\-tween the drives of different CP/M machines.\par

The 1571 and 1572 drives are capable of reading any particular CP/M\_formatted diskette. When you insert a disk\-ette the 1571 disk drive tries to determine the type of storage format. Once the Commodore 128 has figured out how the data is stored, it is an easy matter to read it. Commodore 128 CP/M is also capable of formatting a CP/M disk in any of several formats, so you can write a program that can be read by another popular CP/M computer.\par

What this means is that the formatting features, such as double spacing, justification, and margin settings are visible on the screen before the text is printed. The way the text looks on the screen is the way it will look when it is finally printed. Older text editors were broken into two parts: an editor for entering text and a formatter/printer for printing text. You could not see what the printed copy would look like until it was printed. The ED.COM program that comes with your copy of Commodore 128 CP/M is an ancient relative of WordStar.\par

This installation process is necessary because each CP/M system may have a different size screen or type of terminal, different printer, and even different kinds of keyboards. Different terminals have different protocols for how they put things on the screen. The manufacturers of CP/M appli\-cation programs, such as WordStar, do not want to inventory dozens of different disks for each machine, so they create an installation procedure into their software. When you install a CP/M program, you are basically telling it the characteristics of your screen and printer. The program then\par

Like WordStar, Perfect Writer uses on\_screen for\-matting, but in addition it allows split\_screen editing. This means yout can split the screen into two horizontal windows, and view different parts of the same document, so you can read one section while modifying; another. In fact, Perfect Writer allows you to open seven files at the same' time and edit them simultaneously. Another reason that split windows areas important is that you can cut and paste between two documents while, both are on the screen. In WordStar, you have to save the text to be pasted in a file, quit the current document, reload the new document, and reader in the file of text.\par

An actual dBASE II application program requires technical skill to program, but no technical skill is needed to use the final program. dBASE II has a programming language that you use to create a database.

The modem encodes and decodes information from the computer into a standard \fs24 \f1 \b format of tones. If the \fs24 \f0 \plain \lang1033 remote computer has a modem, the two computers can understand each other and trade infor\-mation. A communications program allows you to easily send and receive files. For example, if you use electronic mail you will need to be able to send memos, letters, and information. Your software should be able to look on your disk for a file containing a letter, and then be able to send it to the mail network. When receiving information from another computer, it needs to be able to open a file on your disk and capture the information. Your communications software also needs to be able to emulate a popular terminal of some kind via your communications program. This is because most information services set up a communications link that expects a certain kind of terminal to be attached.\par

Pro\-tocol means that special error checking is set up between sender and receiver so that no errors occur in the transmission. The reason protocol is needed is that phone lines can have electrical static, or noise, on them which can alter the characters they are sending or receiving. The protocol mode guarantees that the character is sent properly. The most popular protocol is the XMODEM protocol, which was developed by Ward Chris\-tensen and placed in the public domain. XMODEM is part of another modem program, called Modem7, developed by Ward, and is described later in this chapter in the section called "Free Software". The mode for most communications between computers starts out with no protocol. The character that is sent is always echoed so you can see it appear on your screen (this is called \fs29 \f2 \i full \fs24 \f0 \plain \lang1033 duplex mode), but no check is made to see if the right character is echoed. This is called the non\_protocol mode. Which mode you use depends on the kind of file you are sending. A program file, like a COM file, is composed mostly of pure machine codes for the Z80A microprocessor. Sending this file demands protocol mode for it to work. On the other hand, you might not care about accuracy of a memo you are sending to a person via electronic mail.\par

What is really nice is that you set all of these parameters on a screen control panel which is always in view, so that their state can always be known. Since each computer system you talk to may require different sets of parameters, Crosstalk lets you store the settings under a filename, like SOURCE.XTK.

Even though the computers may be quite different hardware\_wise\'97that is, you might have a Commodore 128 communicating with an Osborne\'97if they are both running Crosstalk, file transfer will be easy. People who use Crosstalk to trade public\_domain "squeezed" (compressed) COM files will appreciate the unattended trans\-fer mode. This allows you to use Crosstalk to call up an unattended computer also running Crosstalk, examine the files on that computer's drives, and transfer just the ones you desire. The transfer can be either an XMODEM protocol transfer, where all the characters are checked as they are sent, or in the non\_protocol mode, where there is no accuracy checking. Crosstalk is bulletproof and almost impossible to crash. An online help command gets you descriptions of each command without needing to turn to the manual. Crosstalk is available for many machines, including the IBM PC and the full line of CP/M portables, such as Osborne, Morrow, and Kaypro.\par

A programming language is what was used to create what ultimately became the final "instructions" to your Z80 chip, which make the program do what it does. For example, CP/M, WordStar, and MultiPlan were written in a very low\_level language called assembly language. On the other hand, the Software Fitness Program was written in BASIC, a higher\_level language. There are many different types of computer lan\-guages available for CP/M. Since the CP/M universe was made up in its first years primarily of hackers (computer hobbyists), it has spawned a great number of experimental computer languages, some of which went on to become great commercial products.\par

Generally speaking, BASIC is the most popular language today, primarily because it is easy to learn and use, is available in versions for almost all computers, and is interactive in its operation with the user. Pascal and the newer C language are the next most popular. Pascal is a more serious language, and requires more expertise on the part of the user, but also offers in return more flexibility (and sometimes more speed) than BASIC. Pascal has traditionally been used in the schools to teach upper\_division programming. C is slowly gaining ground on Pascal because it offers even faster and more compact code, and because the famous Unix operating system is based on it. Many professional application products are based on the C language.\par

Bill Gates, now C.E.O. of one of the largest software publishers in the industry, and John Allen, his partner, created Microsoft BASIC back in 1975 to run on the world's first real microcomputer, the Altair 8080. At that early date there were no floppy disks (CP/M was about to arrive), and so Gates and Allen got BASIC running using a paper tape reader and loader. When CP/M came out Gates and his partner quickly brought out a disk\_based version of MBASIC.The program instantly caught on, and since that time Microsoft BASIC has become the de facto standard programming language for CP/M.\par

The interpreter, the most popular form, accepts BASIC commands as you type them and executes programs immediately. The compiler form reads BASIC instructions you have created in a text file using an editor, and usually takes a few minutes to tell you if there are any mistakes. The compiler, however, produces much faster code. Frequently programmers try to use the more friendly interpreter version to get the BASIC program working, and then use the compiler to speed it up. Using Microsoft BASIC under CP/M is very easy. In BASIC each instruction is on a "line" and the line is preceded by a line number. You can then control the program contents through a line editor; you can delete a line by typing its number with nothing after it, or insert a new instruction line by typing the number and the BASIC commands after it. You can get a listing of the entire program or just specific lines. Microsoft BASIC has its own built\_in line editor, but you can also create a program using any of the popular word processors, or even CP/M's crude ED.COM editor. In Microsoft BASIC you are given a complete set of built\_in functions, like SIN, LOG, and EXP, as well as\par

A fully formatted PRINT USING function is provided for output decimal numbers in precise columns. Error checking is good, and you can write your own custom routines to handle user mistakes. Microsoft BASIC provides an interface to memory with the POKE and PEEK commands. A CALL and USR statement allows you to run Z80 machine language programs from Micro\-soft BASIC. The reference manual for Microsoft BASIC is very good, and dozens of programming books are available that teach you how to use it.\par

Since the 80\-column color chip in the Commodore 128 has the same capability as the color board in the IBM PC, it is likely that many programs written on the IBM PC under BASIC that work with color will be easy to rewrite to run on the C128.\par

This allows the Pascal programmer to write much longer programs than would seem possible. Very powerful math process\-ing is provided in this language. Numbers can be as large as 32 bits, and BCD arithmetic for up to 18 digits is provided for computations involving money. (Rounding errors are a real problem with most languages used for business\'97BCD math avoids them at a slight decrease in speed.)\par

C was created by Kernighan and Ritchie of Bell Labs to help them write an operating system called Unix. Pascal would not do because it did not produce compact enough code, was too slow, and didn't have a neat interface to the central processing unit (CPU). Although C has not been available on CP/M for very long, its use has blossomed because of its superiority over other languages for developing powerful programs. C is about halfway between Pascal and assembly language in complexity. It is more cryptic looking than Pascal (at least you can make it look that way if you want), and it is, in general, much faster. C was designed because an operating system is a very complex piece of software that must be fast when used. Writing it in machine language may appear the best approach at first, but when the size of the program becomes huge enough, assembly language becomes unwieldy and uncontrollable. C is well\_structured like Pascal so it can look clear, while it also allows speed\_sensitive parts to be easily interfaced in machine language.\par

The language is not as complete as the one described by Kernighan and Rit\-chie's The C Programming Language (Prentice\_Hall, 1978), but it does contain a large subset of the important features. One of BDS\_C's best features is that it consumes very little memory for even the largest of programs. The language supports a feature called pointers, which is very important to C. The floating point math routines are incompatible with those of Unix C. The compilation speed of programs written in BDS\_C is amazingly fast compared to languages like Pascal, sometimes taking mere\par

The BDS\_C compiler is easy to use because it does not need a lot of complex linkages to run. You compile the program and then link it, and it is ready to run.\par

Utilities are aids that help you work within the CP/M environment. Utilities are also pro\-grams that integrate other applications, give you desk accessory programs that can be called up as needed, like calendars and notepads, or provide tools that make programming CP/M easier. Some of the most popular utility programs provide an interface and set of commands that make CP/M easier to harness.\par

It is a set of utilities that take over where PIP, TYPE, ERASE, and RENAME fear to tread. To run Power!, you simply type its name and it installs itself inside your CP/M, then sits there like your slave. The most useful Power! command is COPY. When you do a DIR with Power! it displays a number before every file. If you then want to copy selected files, you can say COPY 1\_3 7 13 and only files 1 through 3, 7, and 13 will be copied. ERASE works the same way. There are also utilities for checking if there are any bad sectors on your diskette and unerasing files you accidentally erased. Power! uses a friendly menu\_like front end that is good for beginners to learn with. There is also a powerful debugging system for programmers that allows you to read sectors on the disk or memory contents. Several of the ideas for utilities in Power! can be found in various programs in the public domain (see next section).\par

This is because to keep a CP/M program truly generic it can't do anything beyond placing text characters in different places on a screen. There is no color or sound in standard CP/M. This has not stopped games from being developed, just held back the sophistication,\par
