Hello Peter,

I scanned and OCRed the german book "Die Floppy 1571" by Karsten
Schramm, Markt & Technik. You can download it here:

  http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/DieFloppy1571.pdf (approx. 1,4 MB)

Neglecting the commented ROM listing which is quite a mess to be OCRed,
it is complete and proof-read.

Please note:

1. Do not spread this link!

2. If you want to put this PDF on some webspace, please do NOT mention
   my name.

Now, perhaps, you want to add this into iDOC. I read that you prefer
plain text. I must admit that I am not good as ASCII-art. ;)

Which way would be best to include this book into iDOC? Would it make
sense to export the pictures into non-ASCII and "link" to them from the
TXT file?

Would you even be interested in getting that book?

Regards,
   Spiro.

Hello,

it has been quiet on this list for some time, thus, I thought you might
be interested in the following.


I know, some of you already know, but there are news, thus, I am
announcing to all of you.

I'm proud to announce the availability of the scanned versions of the
following books (in German only):

a. Karsten Schramm: "Die Floppy 1541". 
   Markt & Technik 806, 1985, ISBN 3-89090-098-4
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/Floppy1541.zip (ca. 1.2 MB)

b. Karsten Schramm: "Die Floppy 1570/1571". 
   Markt & Technik 90185, 1986, ISBN 3-89090-185-9
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/DieFloppy1571.zip (ca. 2.0 MB)

If this is no reason to learn german (if you don't already know it), I
do not know what else. ;)


Both files are "complete", with the following remarks:

1. All included file listings are included. The bigger files (Appendix
   in a., BurstMon 3.1 in b.) have been generated with PETCAT from the
   VICE package.
   Remark: I have taken BurstMon 3.1 from the 64er SH 25 disk. To me,
   it seems to be identical with the version in the book, but I am not
   completely sure.

2. a., "1541", is missing one page (151) which contains two pictures
   which would need much space to reproduce in good quality.
   This page is available separately as PNG from
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/1541-platine.png (ca. 450 KB)
   
3. The page numbers are kept original, thus, the line numbers of the
   contents and the index can be used to navigate the book. But: cf. 4.

4. The formatting has changed slightly. If a paragraph was to be split
   across two pages, I have left it on one page only. Thus, the contents
   and index (cf. 3.) might deviate by 1 page.

5. If I found errors in the contents, I have not corrected most of them.
   This might be done in some future "revision".
   Anyway, there were some slight corrections in the ROM listing of the
   1570/1571, where the listing was not correct in all cases.

Please note:

1. Do not spread this link!

2. If you want to put this PDF on some webspace, please do NOT mention
   my name.

Although I have tried to contact the original author to get permission
to spread this file, I was not able to get a working address from him.
Thus, if anyone knows how to contact Karsten Schramm, AFAIK one of the
former "chiefs" of GMX, please tell me.


If you have questions or remarks, please contact me directly or via the
mailing list.


What is new w.r.t. the previous releases of these files?

1. (today) The ROM listing and the listing of the BurstMon have been added to
   the "1571" book

2. (Oct 8) The ROM listing and the listings of the files in the appendix
   have been added to the 1541 book.


Now, the next project is "64intern" (Data Becker) which is already
scanned. Unfortunately, the OCR was much less effective on that book,
thus, it needs much more afterwork. :(

Have fun,
   Spiro.

Hello all,

as I write this mail to some people which have not received previous
versions, I include all the text in the sequel.

For the "old ones": I integrated the changes into the book "1541", and I
added another book "64 intern".


I'm proud to announce the availability of the scanned versions of the
following books (in German only):

a. Karsten Schramm: "Die Floppy 1541". 
   Markt & Technik 806, 1985, ISBN 3-89090-098-4
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/DieFloppy1541-2.zip (ca. 1.2 MB)

b. Karsten Schramm: "Die Floppy 1570/1571". 
   Markt & Technik 90185, 1986, ISBN 3-89090-185-9
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/DieFloppy1571.zip (ca. 2.0 MB)

c. Angerhausen, Brückmann, Englisch, Gerits: "64 intern".
   Data Becker, 3rd edition 1983.
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/64intern-v1.zip (ca. 1.2 MB)
 
If this is no reason to learn german (if you don't already know it), I
do not know what else. ;)

   This page is available separately as PNG from
   http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/1541-platine.png (ca. 450 KB)

3. c., "64 intern", is missing the schematics and the register layouts
   on pages 324 and later. The schematic is available in the known
   places (for example, zimmers.net), and the register layouts are not
   that good. It would be better to get the ones from the PRG.
   
4. The page numbers are kept original, thus, the line numbers of the
   contents and the index can be used to navigate the book. But: cf. 4.

5. The formatting has changed slightly. If a paragraph was to be split
   across two pages, I have left it on one page only. Thus, the contents

Hello,

just a short note:

There is a newer version available:

    http://www.trikaliotis.net/download/64intern-v2.zip (ca. 1.2 MB)

It's almost the same size, but some bugs were corrected.

Regards,
